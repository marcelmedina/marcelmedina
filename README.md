## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Biography
I am a Lead Developer, MCT, Azure specialist based in Auckland, New Zealand with over 20 years of experience in the tech industry. A playground enthusiast who is passionate about technology and loves to engage with the technical community to share knowledge and exchange experiences.

In 2022 I started a Meetup group in New Zealand called Coding Night NZ (https://www.meetup.com/coding-night-nz), to enable developers with practical knowledge to excel and launch their careers.

I also have a blog https://tech.playgokids.com where I share my knowledge on .NET and Azure with the technical community.
